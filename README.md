# PokeSteps

A project inspired by Ash Ketchum's journey on building his team and becoming a Pokemon master. 

## :memo: Description

PokeSteps is a Pokedex with a step counter built into it. The motivation for this application is to help users enjoy their fitness journey. Often times, people feel defeated when they do not see the end result after trying for some time, forfeiting right before the life-changing point. This projects hopes to remind users that "the getting there" is just as important as arriving at the destination.

> It's not the destination, it's the journey.

<!-- Record a demo video on when goal is achieved and Pokemon is unlocked -->

## :tennis_shoes: Getting Started

In order to interact with this application, you must build it on a physical device rather than a simulator for HealthKit to retrieve step counts.

### :electric_plug: Build project using a cable

1. Clone this project
2. Open project in Xcode
3. Enable Developer Mode on iOS device (skip if already enabled)

    a. Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > enable Developer Mode toggle

    b. Follow onscreen instructions to restart device

4. Connect phone to to Mac using cable
    
    a. If this is the first time connecting to the computer, you may be prompted to "Trust" this machine
    
5. In the toolbar at the top, click on device name and drop down should pop up
6. Select your iOS device

### :wireless_symbol: Build project over network

A couple of requirements before project can be built onto the device over network:

* iOS device must be set up and added as a run destination (follow Build project using a cable)
* iOS device must be enabled to connect vis network
* iOS device and Mac must be connected to the same network/Wi-Fi

To enable or verify that "connect via network" is enabled:

1. Click on the device name in the toolbar
2. Go to Manage Run Destinations
3. Verify that "Connect via Network" checkbox is checked for the iOS device

Once the above requirements are met, you should be able to select your device as a run destination without connecting it to the Mac. There should be globe icon next to the device name in the drop down menu.

## :classical_building: Architecture

PokeSteps is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern.
